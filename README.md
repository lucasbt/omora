<br/>

**Omora** is a fork of **[Omakub](https://omakub.org/)**, specifically designed for **[Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/pt-br/workstation/)**. It's a tool that turns a fresh Fedora Workstation installation into a fully-configured, modern development environment with a single command.

While **Omora** shares many core concepts with **Omakub**, it's adapted to fit the needs and tools that I personally use for development on Fedora ecosystem. This version streamlines the setup process for Fedora users, bringing the latest and greatest tools for web development, all configured and ready to go.

### Key Features:
- **Fedora-first**: Tailored to work seamlessly with Fedora, optimized for Fedora’s package management and system structure.
- **One-line setup**: Set up your entire development environment with just a single command.
- **Custom configurations**: Includes configurations and software that I personally use for development on Fedora.
- **Modern developer stack**: Pre-configured with a modern toolset, including essential command-line utilities, programming languages, and development tools.

### Installation

To get started with Omora, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucasbt/omora/main/install.sh)"
```

This will install all necessary tools and configure your Fedora system to be ready to use.

### What’s New in Omora?

Omora is a Fedora-specific version of Omakub. While it retains the main principles of the original project, it has been adapted for Fedora's environment, including:
- **Fedora-specific optimizations**
- **Pre-configured software stack** based on my personal development preferences
- **Custom configurations** and tweaks to suit the Fedora user experience

### Why Omora?

Omora is for _**Fedora users**_ who want a fast, streamlined development setup. If you're tired of manually installing and configuring every tool, Omora gives you a fully-configured environment right from the start, optimized for Fedora. It's the easiest way to get up and running with a modern development setup, quickly and efficiently.
